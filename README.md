# Simple Encryption and Decryption Program

This is a simple encryption and decryption program written in Python. It uses a **basic substitution cipher** technique to encrypt and decrypt text.

## Encryption
Encryption turns readable data (plaintext) into unreadable data (ciphertext) using an algorithm and a key, ensuring data confidentiality and security.

## Decryption
Decryption reverses this process, converting ciphertext back into plaintext using the appropriate key and algorithm.

## Types of Encryption:

1) Symmetric Encryption:
Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.
Examples: DES, AES, 3DES.
2) Asymmetric Encryption:
Uses a pair of keys - public key for encryption and private key for decryption.
Public key is freely available, private key is kept secret.
Examples: RSA, DSA, ECC.
